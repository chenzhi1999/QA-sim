# Quantum astrometry sim

Code inside data_analysis/Analysis.ipynb is mostly developed by jschiff11.

Data_analysis file analyzes binary files for an experimental setup.

MCMC.ipynb provides a Jupyter Notebook file for star pair filtration based on the month, data sampling, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure to estimate the precision of the separation between stars through two-photon interferometry.

MCMC.ipynb uses MCMC code provided from anze slosar, see slosar/april for more detail.

To install quasim on local machine, run:
python setup.py install
